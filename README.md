Ocaml Labs
### Lab1
#### Write three recursive OCaml functions that perform computations with lists.
 - How Many
 - Delete
 - Mean
### Lab2
#### Write some OCaml functions that perform arithmetic with rational numbers. Use these functions to compute a rational approximation to e, the base of natural logarithms.

### Lab3
#### Write an OCaml function that deletes a node from a binary search tree (BST).

### Lab4
#### Write a CPS function that produces all permutations of a list.

### Lab5
 - Streams
 
### Lab6
#### Write OCaml functions that perform operations on mutable queues.

### Lab7
 - Memoization

### Lab8
#### Write a few simple functions using OCamlâ€™s built-in lazy evaluation mechanism.

### Lab9
#### Write a print function for the Lisp interpreter.

### Lab10
#### Translate three Lisp functions into equivalent OCaml functions.
 - Every
 - Substitute
 - Questy-equal

### Lab11
#### Modify the Lisp interpreter so it can evaluate three kinds of expressions.
 - Atom
 - Imply
 - Let
